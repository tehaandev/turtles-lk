            <h3>Habitat loss due to beachfront development and erosion.</h3>
            <section class="threat-info intro-para">
                <p>Habitat loss due to beachfront development and erosion is a major threat to sea turtles in Sri Lanka. It forces female turtles to lay their eggs in suboptimal locations, which can result in lower hatch rates and a reduced population. To prevent habitat loss, conservationists must work with local communities and policymakers to develop sustainable beachfront development plans that consider the importance of turtle nesting habitats. Education and awareness programs can also help to highlight the importance of sea turtle conservation and encourage individuals to take action to protect these incredible creatures. By taking steps to prevent habitat loss, we can help to ensure that sea turtles have a safe and secure place to nest and thrive.</p>

            <h3>Poaching of turtle eggs for consumption or sale.</h3>
            <section class="threat-info intro-para">
                <p>Poaching of turtle eggs for consumption or sale is a significant threat to sea turtles in Sri Lanka. It leads to a decline in the turtle population and affects the ability of turtles to reproduce successfully. Poaching also disrupts the natural balance of the ecosystem and affects the wider community that depends on healthy marine ecosystems for their livelihoods</p>
                <p>To prevent poaching, conservationists work with local communities to raise awareness about the importance of sea turtle conservation and the consequences of poaching. Additionally, laws and regulations are enforced to deter poaching and ensure that those who break the law are held accountable. Furthermore, community-based initiatives such as ecotourism and alternative livelihood programs are developed to provide alternative sources of income to those who would otherwise resort to poaching. By addressing the root causes of poaching and providing sustainable solutions, we can help to protect sea turtles and preserve the delicate balance of the marine ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>Accidental capture in fishing nets.</h3>
            <section class="threat-info intro-para">
                <p>Accidental capture in fishing nets, also known as bycatch, is a major threat to sea turtles in Sri Lanka. Turtles can become entangled in nets and drown, and the use of non-selective fishing gear increases the risk of bycatch. Bycatch also affects the wider ecosystem by disrupting the food chain and reducing the population of important species.</p><p>To prevent accidental capture, regulations and laws are enforced to limit the use of non-selective fishing gear, and turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) are installed in fishing nets to prevent turtles from becoming entangled. Additionally, education and awareness programs are developed to encourage sustainable fishing practices and to highlight the importance of sea turtle conservation. By reducing accidental capture and promoting sustainable fishing practices, we can help to protect sea turtles and maintain a healthy marine ecosystem.</p>

                    <p>Sea turtle safety and conservation are our top priorities at our turtle hatchery. We remove turtle eggs from unsafe nesting locations and carefully incubate them until they are mature enough to be returned to the ocean. Our goal is to teach people about sea turtle protection while also providing guided tours of our hatchery. We are proud of our dedication to environmentally friendly techniques and responsible tourism, and we work together with regional communities to further these practices. Come to our hatchery to help us safeguard these incredible creatures.   </p>
